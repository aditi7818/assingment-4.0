    "Question: Explain class and object with respect to object-oriented Programming.Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "class of object-oriented programming:\n",
    "A class is a user-defined blueprint of an object that describes what a specific kind of object will look like. A class description consists\n",
    "of two things:\n",
    "attributes, and Implementations of behaviour.\n",
    "For Example, a mobile phone has attribute like a brand name, RAM, and functions like texting and calling. Thus, the mobile phone is a class of various phones\n",
    "(the objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an object?\n",
    "an object is a single instance of a class, which contains data and methods working on that data. so an object consists of three things:\n",
    "    Name: This is a variable name that repersents the object.\n",
    "    Member data: The data that describes the object.\n",
    "    Member methods: Behavior that describes the object. \n",
    "For example, Samsung galaxy is an object with the brand name samsung, 2GB RAM sa properties, and calling and texting as behaviours."

    "Question: What is Inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquries the propety of another class. \n",
    "For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of inheritance:\n",
    "1) Single Inheritance : single inheritance allows a derivate class to inherit properties of one parent class, and this allows code reuse and the introduction of additional \n",
    "featues in existing code.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# python program for demondtrating single inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "# here, we will create the base class or the parent class\n",
    "class parent1:\n",
    "    def func_1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This function is defined inside the parent class\")\n",
    "# now, we will create the derived class\n",
    "class child1(parent1):\n",
    "    def func_2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"this function is defined inside the child class\")\n",
    "# Driver's code\n",
    "object= child1()\n",
    "object.func_1()\n",
    "object.func_2()\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Multiple Inheritance: if a class is able to created from multiple base classes, this kind of inheritance is known as multiple inheritance. when there is multiple inheritance,\n",
    "each of the attributes that are present in the classes of the base hs been passed on to the class that is derived from it.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# Here, we will create the base class 1\n",
    "class Mother1:\n",
    "    mothername1=\"\"\n",
    "    def mother1(self):\n",
    "        print(self.mothername1)\n",
    "        \n",
    "#here, we will create the base class 2\n",
    "class father1:\n",
    "    fathername1= \"\"\n",
    "    def father1(self):\n",
    "        print(self.fathername1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#now, we will create the derivative class\n",
    "class son1(mother1, father1):\n",
    "    def parents1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"father name is:\", self.fathername1)\n",
    "        print(\"mother name is:\", self.mothername1)\n",

    "s1.mothername1= \"sherya\"\n",
    "s1.parents 1()\n",
    "\n",
    "3) multilevel inheritance, the features that are part of the original class, as well as the class that is derived from it, are passed on to the new class.\n",
    "it is similar to a relationship involving grandparents and childern.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "#Here, we will create the base class\n",
    "class grandfather1:\n",
    "    def__init__(self, grandfathername1):\n",
    "        self.grandfathername1 = grandfathername1\n",
    "        \n",
    "#here, we will create the intermediate class\n",
    "class father1(grandfather1):\n",
    "    def__init__(self,fathername1,grandfathername1):\n",
    "        self.fathername1 = fathername1\n",
    "#here, we will create the derived class \n",
    "class son1(father1):\n",
    "    def__init__(self, sonname1, fathername1, grandfathername1):\n",
    "        self.sonname1 = sonname1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #here, we will invoke the constructor of father class\n",
    "        father1__init__(self,fathername1, granfdfathername1)\n",
    "    def print_name(self):\n",
    "        print('grandfather name is:', self.grandfathername1)\n",
    "        print(\"father name is:\",self.fathername1)\n",
    "        print(\"son name is:\",self.sonname 1)\n",
    "#driver code\n",
    "s1= son1('john','john jr',john jr jr')\n",
    "print(s1.grandfathername1)\n",
    "s1.print_name()\n",
    "         \n",
    "4) HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE if multiple derived classes are created from the same base, this kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical inheritance. In this instance, we have two \n",
    "classes as a parent(base) clas as well as two children (derived) classes.\n",
    "\n",
